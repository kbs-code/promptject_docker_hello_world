Certainly! Here are the requirements for a beginner-friendly project that you can use to learn Docker with Node.js:

**Project Name:** "Hello World" Dockerized Web Application

**Project Description:** In this project, you will create a simple web application that displays "Hello World" on a web page. You will then containerize the application using Docker and run it in a Docker container.

**Project Requirements:**

**Programming Language:** Node.js
**Web Framework:** Express.js
**Web Server:** Nginx
**Containerization Tool:** Docker
**Container Registry:** Docker Hub
**Version Control System:** Git

**Step-by-Step Guide:**

1. **Create a new directory for your project:** Open a terminal window and create a new directory for your project. You can name it anything you like. For example, mkdir hello-world-docker.
2. **Create a new Node.js project:** Inside the directory you just created, create a new Node.js project by running the following command: `npm init -y`. This will create a new package.json file.
3. **Install Express.js and Nginx:** In your terminal window, install Express.js and Nginx by running the following command: npm install express nginx.
4. **Write the code for your web application:** In your project directory, create a new file called app.js. This file will contain the code for your web application. Write the following code:

```
const express = require('express');

const app = express();

app.get('/', (req, res) => {

  res.send('Hello World!');

});

app.listen(3000, () => {

  console.log('Example app listening on port 3000!');

});

```

1. **Test your web application:** In your terminal window, run the following command: `node app.js`. This will start the Express.js web server and your web application will be available at http://localhost:3000. Open a web browser and navigate to http://localhost:3000 to see your "Hello, World!" message.
1. **Create a Dockerfile:** In your project directory, create a new file called Dockerfile. This file will contain the instructions for building your Docker image.
1. **Write the Dockerfile:** In Dockerfile, write the following code:

```
FROM node:14

WORKDIR /app

COPY package\*.json ./

RUN npm install

COPY . .

EXPOSE 3000

CMD ["npm", "start"]
```

1. **Build your Docker image:** In your terminal window, run the following command to build your Docker image: docker build -t hello-world-docker .. This will build a Docker image called hello-world-docker.
1. **Push your Docker image to Docker Hub:** In your terminal window, run the following command to push your Docker image to Docker Hub: docker push your-docker-username/hello-world-docker. Replace your-docker-username with your Docker Hub username.
1. **Run your Docker container:** In your terminal window, run the following command to run your Docker container: docker run -p 80:3000 your-docker-username/hello-world-docker. This will start your Docker container and your web application will be available at http://localhost. Open a web browser and navigate to http://localhost to see your "Hello, World!" message.

That's it! You have successfully created a Dockerized web application with Node.js. I hope this helps you learn Docker. Let me know if you have any questions.
